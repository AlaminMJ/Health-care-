Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The rain and thunder, the wind and haze. I’m bound for better days. It’s my life and my dream, nothing’s going to stop me now.In an age when nature and magic rule the world, there is an extraordinary legend: the story of a warrior who communicates with animals, who fights sorcery and the unnatural. His name is Dar, last of his tribe. He is also called Beastmaster Extraordinary crimes against the people and the state had to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional; and his partner, Emma Peel, talented amateur… otherwise known as The Avengers.Look for the Union Label when you are buying a coat, dress, or blouse. Remember, somewhere our union’s sewing, our wages going to feed the kids, and run the house. We work hard, but who’s complaining. Thanks to the I.L.G. we’re paying our way. So always look for the Union Label. It means we’re able to make it in the U.S.A.!"

Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You’re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas; you’ve just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.    The year is 1987 and NASA launches the last of America’s deep space probes. In a freak mishap, Ranger 3 and its pilot Captain William ‘Buck’ Rogers are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support system and returns Buck Rogers to Earth five hundred years later."
